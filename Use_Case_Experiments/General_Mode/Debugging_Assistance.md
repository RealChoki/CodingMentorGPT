### **Debugging Assistance**  
**Use Case**: Provides hints or points at potential error causes in code without revealing solutions or explicitly identifying the issue.  

#### **Tasks**  
- **Task 1**: Identifies potential errors in student code.  
- **Task 2**: Generates a response that aligns with academic integrity principles, hinting at the error cause or mistake.  

---

#### **Experiment: Debugging and Hint Generation**  

- **Input**: Code snippet and query from the student (e.g., "Why is my function not returning the expected result?").  
- **Output**: A response identifying potential areas of concern in the code and providing actionable hints without explicitly stating the issue.  
- **Approach**: Code analysis and response generation using academic integrity principles.  
- **Message Flow**:  
  1. Student submits code and query to the assistant.  
  2. Model analyzes the code for errors (syntax, logical, or semantic).  
  3. Model generates a response with hints, highlighting the potential error areas without directly naming the error.  

- **Tools**: file_search.  
- **Models**: OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini).  
- **Prompt Techniques**:  
  - **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Breaks down the analysis into steps for better reasoning.  
  - **Step-Back Prompting**: Ensures hints are clear and comply with integrity rules.  
  - **Error Abstraction**: Focuses on patterns rather than explicit error identification.  

- **Evaluation Criteria**:  
  - **Correctness**: Are the identified errors accurate?  
  - **Clarity**: Is the feedback understandable and concise?  
  - **Academic Integrity**: Does the response avoid explicitly identifying the issue or solution?
